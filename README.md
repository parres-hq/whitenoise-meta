# White Noise Meta

## What is this?

A place to store research, discusssions, and learnings related to building White Noise.

## Why?

Given we're building something fundamentally new, there are many decisions that we're making-implicitly or explicitly-that will have long-lasting consequences. We want these to be as transparent as possible so that future devs (including ourselves) can always refer back to our thinking.
